SBCG: Schrodinger bridge based deep conditional generative learning

Conditional generative models represent a significant advancement in machine learning, enabling controlled data synthesis by incorporating additional information into the generation process. Schrodinger bridge-based conditional generative learning (SBCG) begins with a unit-time diffusion process governed by a stochastic differential equation (SDE) that evolves a fixed point at time t=0 into a desired target conditional distribution at t=1. SBCG is implemented by discretizing the SDE using the Euler-Maruyama method and estimating the drift term nonparametrically with a deep neural network.
